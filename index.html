    <p>Hi, my name is Carlos Leon and I am a BYU-I Software Engineering 
      student. I love Physics research, 
      but I am improving my Data Science and software developing skills 
      to better perform my main areas of interests.  </p>

    <p>My current job requires several software developing 
      skills for offshore management software. Plans for this project include
      presenting the software as a web application. So, this course on web development
      would allow me to help my team better. </p>

    <p>Although I don't have much free time, I always set aside a special time to spend with 
      my two-year old son who is learning at an impressive speed for me. And who knows, perhaps someday
      we will play violins together.</p>
